# music-maker

This is a code test to create an application to use the API of JAM, a company that does magic with music.

## To install the application once downloaded
```
npm install
```

### To run the application once everything is installed
```
npm run serve
```

### Overview

The application is made with Vue CLI 3, so it will run on the localhost port:8080. 

The use of APIs could not be possible because the use of CORS by the server has been impossible to make GET or POST requests with that header. 

So I made the app with local data taken from "https://api-stg.jam-community.com/song/trending".

A test should be added to check the functionality of all requests.

I created the Profile component on the assumption that I had to put information about the artist, but in the end it is unnecessary.

Hope you enjoy! :D
